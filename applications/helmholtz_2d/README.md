# Helmholtz Numerical Example

* Generate training data used in numerical example:

`python generate_helmholtz.py`

* Neural network training for [**Derivative-Informed Projected Neural Networks for High-Dimensional Parametric Maps Governed by PDEs**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15110) done in `dipnet_paper/`
